A bicycle-sharing system is a service in which users can rent/use bicycles available for shared use on a short term basis for a price or free. 

Systems usually aim to reduce congestion, noise, and air pollution by providing free/affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips in an urban area as opposed to motorized vehicles. 

The number of users on any given day can vary greatly for such systems.
